# MSc_Projects
Welcome to my MSc project repository! This repository showcases the collection of projects I have completed as part of my MSc in Automotive Engineering with a focus on Electric Vehicles. Each project is a testament to my expertise in various aspects of automotive systems, vehicle dynamics, simulation, and electric vehicles.

## Repository Overview
This repository includes the following projects:

### Advanced Vehicle Dynamics
The coursework in this module focused on three key areas:

1. Tire Model
F-Tire, RMOD-K, and Tame Tire models were explored to understand tire dynamics and their impact on vehicle handling and performance.
2. Suspension Optimization
Focused on the modeling and simulation of suspension systems. Optimization principles were applied to enhance suspension performance using Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF), Two Degrees of Freedom (2DOF), and Four Degrees of Freedom (4DOF) models.
3. Derivatives and Bicycle Model
Calculated and compared yaw rate response to a step steer input using parameters of neutral steering and a critically damped vehicle model.
Performed derivative analysis and derived key parameters.
Developed ADAMS models and compared results with derivative analysis.

### Advanced Powertrain Engineering
This module included two primary areas of focus:

1. Modeling and Simulation of an Euro IV Vehicle
Developed a model to estimate fuel economy and emission levels for various legislative and real-world drive cycles.
Identified key parameters that affect fuel efficiency and emissions, providing insight into optimizing powertrain systems.
2. Hybrid Electric Vehicle Powertrain Model and Control Strategy
Discussed the design and control strategies for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrains, including energy management and optimization techniques.

### Crash Impact and Modeling
The crash impact coursework focused on the Crash Analysis of a Battery Enclosure:

Conducted physical crash tests and simulations using LS-DYNA to evaluate the durability and performance of a battery enclosure made from composite materials.
Focused on assessing the effectiveness of the impact attenuator and ensuring the battery's structural integrity under crash conditions.

### Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH)
The NVH coursework covered two main projects:

1. Design and Development of a Tuned Vibration Absorber
Focused on reducing flexural vibrations on a beam by designing and developing a tuned vibration absorber.
2. Acoustic Analysis of Car Cavity
Analyzed the acoustic behavior within the car cavity, focusing on noise and vibration control.

### Electric Vehicles
The electric vehicle module was divided into two coursework projects:

1. Inverter Operation and Regenerative Braking Circuit
In-depth exploration of the operation and working principles of the inverter and regenerative braking circuits in electric vehicles.
2.  Cell Balancing Techniques
Discussed various cell balancing techniques for battery management.
Simulated and analyzed issues related to battery pack models without cell balancing circuits.
